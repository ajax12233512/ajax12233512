# Whats good yall!

Currently a Full Stack Software Developer specializing in Javascript development. 
My favorite UI Framework to use is React.js and I can debug, test, and create anything 
that comes to my mind. Front-End Development is a passion of mine along with programming
in general. Aside from web applications, I am currently learning about blockchain
technology and the emerging movement of decentrialized applications through 
Ethereum Smart contracts. Some cool stuff bro... ðŸ‘€

# So What Can You Do Though?
Expert developer and troubleshooter in any Javascript environment. I have extensive experience with NPM, Node.js, and most
of its most popular packages, libraries and dependencies. My main expertise comes in the form of building web applications 
in teams with others, but I also love programming by myself on my own side projects.
